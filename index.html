    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>

    <p>As a college student, I have a lot of free time to do things that I like. During my own time, I love listening to music. My favorite kind of music is Hip-hop, and I listen to rap songs in different languages, such as Korean, Chinese, and English. I found that various kinds of languages make the rhymes of rap songs unique.<br> 
        My other hobby is visiting museums. I think history is fun, and all historical stories which made the world becomes what it is now are really meaningful. Therefore, when I am traveling, I always visit museums to learn about the cultures. Museums are always quiet and organized, so I feel calm while I am walking around the exhibits. I enjoy how museums use pictures, sounds, and sometimes even touch interactions to educate people.<br> 
        Last but not least, I love playing video games. During the pandemic, I stayed at home and tried several video games. <strong>League of Legends</strong> became my favorite game. Before I joined this game, I thought that the game was very hard, and it was just people who use magic skills to win combats. However, I played League of Legends for months now, and I am good at the game. I also think the game is interesting when you can play with your friends as a team.
