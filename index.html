						<p>As a college student, I have a lot of free time to do things that I like. During my own time, I love listening to music. My favorite kind of music is Hip-hop, and I listen to rap songs in different languages, such as Korean, Chinese, and English. I found that various kinds of languages make the rhymes of rap songs unique.

							<p>My other hobby is visiting museums. I think history is fun, and all historical stories which made the world becomes what it is now are really meaningful. Therefore, when I am traveling, I always visit museums to learn about the cultures. Museums are always quiet and organized, so I feel calm while I am walking around the exhibits. I enjoy how museums use pictures, sounds, and sometimes even touch interactions to educate people.

								<p>Last but not least, I love playing video games. During the pandemic, I stayed at home and tried several video games. 
									<strong>League of Legends</strong> became my favorite game. Before I joined this game, I thought that the game was very hard, and it was just people who use magic skills to win combats. However, I played League of Legends for months now, and I am good at the game. I also think the game is interesting when you can play with your friends as a team.

									<p>Before I came to Michigan, I was in a high school located in Virginia. It was an all-girls school, and it only has around 100 students. I was an international student, so I studied hard to improve my English. My high school was a life turning point for me because I found out my true self. During high school, I learned how to be courageous and positive. I joined several clubs, such as the 
										<em>Honor Council</em>, the 
										<em>Recycling Team</em>, and the 
										<em>Art Club</em>.I made friends all around the world.
									</p>
									<p>I chose to come to 
										<strong>MSU</strong> because I liked this school after I learned about the culture here. Our school has strong sports teams, and East Lansing is a safe and diverse city. Students and teachers seemed to be very welcoming and kind. I wanted to choose 
										<em>Media</em> as my major, and I knew that 
										<strong>MSU</strong> could provide all the resources that I will need to achieve my goals in the future. 
									</p>
									<p>Now I am a junior, and I loved my experience in college. I have worked hard in all my classes, but I enjoyed my life as much as I can. I felt no regret in my three years at 
										<strong>MSU</strong>.
